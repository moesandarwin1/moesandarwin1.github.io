        <p>Anne-Marie Rose Nicholson is a singer and songwriter from England. She has been featured on several hit singles till date, including Clean Bandit's "Rockabye", "Friends", "Alarm" and "Ciao Adios".

Aside from West End commitments, she spent her early years struggling to become a pop singer and also tried her luck in professional karate championships at least three times.</p>
        <p>Anne-Marie has said that it was karate that taught her focus and discipline, the two essential characteristics of a successful musician. She has been practicing karate since the age of nine. She won double gold and gold and silver in the Funakoshi Shotokan Karate Association World Championships in 2002 and 2007 respectively. She has also won the gold in the United Kingdom Traditional Karate Federation National Championships. She pursued her music career alongside karate and her debut album 'Speak Your Mind' was released in April 2018. In 2013, Anne-Marie released a solo demo for the Rocket Records called "Summer Girl".

On 10 June 2015, she released her debut EP titled 'Karate'</p>

Two singles from the album, "Karate," a slick fusion of R&B and electro-grime, and the follow-up "Gemini," became hits. In November that year, the British singer released the single "Do It Right", which managed to peak at # 90 on the UK Singles Chart. Then in May 2016, she released the first track from her debut studio album, "Alarm". The same year, Clean Bandit came out with a song "Rockabye" that featured Anne-Marie as the main vocalist.

On 22 September 2017, she released the single "Heavy", followed by "Then". In 2018, the British singer cum songwriter collaborated with Marshmello on the song "Friends".
